  <h2>Hey there, I’m Sridevi</h2>
  <p>Hello! I’m Sridevi Velpula, a DevOps Engineer who’s still learning, still figuring things out, and always curious about how things work behind the scenes.</p>

  <h2>How I Got Started</h2>
  <p>When I first stepped into DevOps, I honestly didn’t know much. Everything felt new and a bit overwhelming pipelines, cloud, containers, YAML everywhere! I started with certifications based on what my projects needed. Slowly, with each new task, I got a chance to explore different tools and concepts: Azure, AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, Terraform, ArgoCD, Prometheus, Grafana, and more. That’s when things really started clicking.</p>

  <h2>Learning by Doing</h2>
  <p>Most of what I know today comes from jumping in, hitting roadblocks, running into issues, and spending hours troubleshooting until I finally got something to work. It wasn’t always easy, sometimes frustrating, but the process of working through real problems, even when it took time, helped me build confidence and truly understand what’s actually happening in the background. Those “finally got it!” moments made all the effort worth it.</p>

  <h2>Why I Started This Blog</h2>
  <p>I created this blog to document what I have learned in a practical, real way. While I write mostly about my hands-on experiences and real scenarios, I also include some theory to help explain the concepts better. This space is for anyone who feels stuck or wants a simpler, clearer way to learn DevOps.</p>

  <h2>What You’ll Find Here</h2>
  <p>Whether it’s tutorials on setting up CI/CD pipelines, fixing deployment issues, or preparing for interviews, I share what I have learned from real experience. If anything here saves you time or helps you understand something tricky, then I’m happy.</p> 

  <h2>Still Learning</h2>
  <p>I’m learning something new every day whether it's a better way to automate a task, a new tool I hadn’t used before, or a tricky bug waiting to be solved. This blog is my way of sharing that ongoing journey.</p>

  <p>Thanks for being here and I hope you find something helpful along the way!</p>
